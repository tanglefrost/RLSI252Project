We have finished reading the paper and roughly clarified the project framework.
We have done the preliminary coding of the algorithm. Please check the file 'Algorithms'.

date 5/14/2025
We fixed a critical bug in the 'Algorithms' file.  
We have completed the writing of the file 'Run_Bandit',
which, when combined with the algorithm file, fully implements the OTO algorithm described in the original paper. 
However, at present, we have only implemented the case where the horizon is known. 
We will first check for bugs and other issues. 
If no errors are found, we will then proceed to write the code for the case where the horizon is unknown.

date 5/20/2025
We have completed the implementation of the OTO algorithm under the known horizon scenario, which corresponds to the setup of Experiment 1 in the paper, 
and have successfully reproduced the experimental results. All bugs have been fixed. 
Next, we will proceed to reproduce Experiment 2, which involves the implementation of the code under the unknown horizon scenario.

date 5/26/2025
We have completed the code implementation for the unknown horizon scenario and have preliminarily passed the tests. 
Now we can say that we have fully reproduced the experimental results of the original paper. 
Next, we will attempt to make some minor improvements to the original algorithm and conduct further tests.
